Pros:

Hide the private part of the class
The binary compatibility ABI isnâ€™t broken if you change something in the pimpl idiom class
Lesser header dependencies => because most header now only needs to be in the *.cpp
Faster compilation times
Cons:

The pimpl idiom could slow down your code (because there is always a pointer access) but there are some technique to speed up a pimpl idiom
Extra heap-allocation
